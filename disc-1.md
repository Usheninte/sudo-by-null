# DISC 1

power is not a thing to sought  
of bought like a corrupt vote  
it is not a thing to be sold  
it not a thing to be abused  
it is taken by the bold  

i am no perfect man  
my sins are electric  
but i know, god knows i know  
that our path to redemption  
lies not in aging men  
or foolish parties  
but in the order that comes  
from the mistakes children  
are permitted to make

my stake i claim  
even if it will cause  
the skies to quake  
even if it will make  
men lesser shake  

even if it will cause  
the children of nubia strong  
to fall on rocks  
and scream in pain  
for the truth  
can prove like ice in the vein  

i do not fear  
the end or repercussion  
for my voice must be heard  
and my soul must rise and kiss the sky  
like a golden dark cloud
